## Installation

Getting Afterglow up and running is quick and easy. Afterglow uses a **Docker-based installation**, allowing for rapid deployment, and giving you the flexibility of **self-hosting**. You can install Afterglow on your local machine or on a server of your choice.

For detailed installation instructions, please visit the [Installation Guide](installation.md).

### Why Docker and Self-Hosting?

- **Quick Setup**: Docker containers package all the necessary components, so you can get Afterglow running in just a few commands.
- **Flexibility**: Self-hosting gives you full control over your environment, allowing customization to fit your organization's needs.
- **Security**: Keep your data in-house and under your control, ensuring compliance with your security policies.
- **Consistency**: Docker ensures that Afterglow runs the same way in any environment, reducing potential setup issues.
